NOTES (Please Read):

1. NOTE: It is highly recommended to use the feedburner service to burn feeds, and enable "Convert format burner" service inside Optimize tab and select "Convert feed format to: RSS 2.0" to ensure the best compatibility.

2. We are not pro developers, but we hope You'll appreciate our work!
